"""This module adds the linear constraints to enforce symmetry conditions on the rail
Constraints between points in the same position in the xy-plane are added by the following equations

.. math::

    u_x^{(\\mathrm{c})} &= u_x^{(\\mathrm{r})} 

    u_y^{(\\mathrm{c})} &= u_y^{(\\mathrm{r})}

    u_z^{(\\mathrm{c})} &= u_z^{(\\mathrm{r})} + 
    \\frac{(z^{(\\mathrm{c})} - z^{(\\mathrm{r})})}{L_\\mathrm{rail}} \\left[u_z^{(\\mathrm{rp})} + 
    (y-y^{(\\mathrm{rp})})\\phi_x^{(\\mathrm{rp})}\\right]
    
:math:`u_x^{(\\mathrm{c})}, u_y^{(\\mathrm{c})}, u_z^{(\\mathrm{c})}, u_x^{(\\mathrm{r})}, 
u_y^{(\\mathrm{r})}, u_z^{(\\mathrm{r})}` are the :math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`z` displacements of 
the constrained, :math:`(\\mathrm{c})`, and retained, :math:`(\\mathrm{r})`, degrees of freedom. 
:math:`x, y` are the :math:`x` and :math:`y` coordinates of the points, and :math:`z^{(\\mathrm{c})}` 
and :math:`z^{(\\mathrm{r})}` are the :math:`z`-coordinates of the constrained and retained points 
respectively. :math:`x^{(\\mathrm{rp})}, y^{(\\mathrm{rp})}, z^{(\\mathrm{rp})}` are the :math:`x,y,z` 
coordinates of the reference point. 
:math:`u_x^{(\\mathrm{rp})}, u_y^{(\\mathrm{rp})}, u_z^{(\\mathrm{rp})}` are the displacements of the 
reference point and 
:math:`\\phi_x^{(\\mathrm{rp})}, \\phi_y^{(\\mathrm{rp})}, \\phi_z^{(\\mathrm{rp})}` are its rotations 
around the :math:`x,y,z` axes. Finally, :math:`L_\\mathrm{rail}` is the length of the rail. 

The nodes at the bottom of the rail are constrained according to above, but with 
:math:`u_x^{(\\mathrm{r})} = u_y^{(\\mathrm{r})} = u_z^{(\\mathrm{r})} = 0` and 
:math:`z^{(\\mathrm{r})} = 0`

In summary, the height of the reference point determines the neutral line for bending. This will be 
up to the user to set, and then the load can be set accordingly. E.g. putting it at the top of the 
rail will give zero normal strains in the surface when prescribing the bending. Putting it in the 
neutral line of the rail profile will give a more natural bending and normal prescribation.
