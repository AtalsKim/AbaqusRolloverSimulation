# Define functions that allow to get things such as the model, instances etc. 
# Recommended to import as "import get_utils as get"
# Hence, the functions can be called by e.g. "get.model()"
# Functions in this file should therefore not include the word get as this is implicit when the 
# suggested import structure is used.
