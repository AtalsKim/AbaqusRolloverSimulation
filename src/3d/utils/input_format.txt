# type, x, y, radius
# types
#  p	Point (x,y): 			Create a point (only used for the first line)
#  l	Line (x,y): 			Create a line from previous (x,y) to current (x,y)
#  tc	Tangent circle (x,y,r)	Create a circle tangent to the previous line segment with radius r
#  f 	Fillet (x,y,r)			Create a line from previous (x,y) to current (x,y) and add fillet 
#								with a radius r
#  c 	Circle (x,y, xc, yc, d)	Create circle from previous (x,y) to current (x,y) with center 
#								(xc,yc). If d=1, clockwise, if d=0, counterclockwise.
#  s 	Spline (x,y)			From point before and for as long as type spline, add points to a 
#								spline.
