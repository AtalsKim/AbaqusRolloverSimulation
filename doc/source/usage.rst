The rollover simulation consists of an elastic wheel rolling over a rail. 
To apply the "wormhole" boundary condition for the wheel, a set of user
subroutines (usub) are used. So in order to setup and run 
the simulation, the user must do the following steps

1. `Create the rail`_ ("Rail ``.cae`` file")
2. `Create the wheel`_ ("Wheel folder")
3. `Compile user subroutines`_ ("usub (``.obj/.o`` file)"). 
   Normally not required each time
4. `Create the rollover simulation`_ ("Input files")
5. `Run simulation`_

Most of the scripts rely on a ``.json`` formatted settings file, for 
further details on this format see `The json format`_. 

Create the rail
===============
The rail is (typically) created by first calling the 
`create_rail_3d.py` abaqus script (see `Create a basic rail`_). This 
creates a ``.cae`` file. This file can then be edited to adapt to the 
specific simulation (see `Modifying the basic rail`_). The end product 
will be a ``.cae`` file that may be convenient to store 
in the data/rails folder in the repository 
(see `The data folder and how to specify paths`_).

Create a basic rail
-------------------
A basic rail is created by calling the abaqus script 
`create_rail_3d.py`
from a folder containing a file `rail_settings.json` This file should 
contain the following settings:

- ``"material"`` (optional): Describes the material model and 
  parameters to be applied to the entire rail. See `Material 
  specification`_. If not given, an elastic material will be set.
- ``"rail_profile"`` (mandatory): Path to an Abaqus sketch, saved as a 
  ``.sat`` file, describing the profile of the rail in the xy-plane. See
  "Creating a profile sketch" for further details.
- ``"rail_length"`` (mandatory): The length (z) of the rail to be 
  created
- ``"rail_name"`` (mandatory): The name of the ``.cae`` file to be 
  created
- ``"refine_region"`` (optional): ``[[xmin, ymin], [xmax, ymax]]`` 
  Describes a rectangle within which the fine mesh will be applied and
  from which the contact surface will be defined. If not given, the 
  entire rail will be finely meshed, and the entire surface will be set 
  as contact surface.
- ``"point_in_refine_cell"`` (mandatory): ``[x,y,z]`` A point that is 
  inside the refined cell (i.e. both within "refine_region" and inside 
  the sketched profile). 
- ``"fine_mesh"`` (mandatory): The element size for the fine mesh
- ``"coarse_mesh"`` (mandatory): The element size for the coarse mesh.
- ``"sym_dir"`` (optional): The direction of the symmetry plane. If not
  given, no symmetry is assumed. If given, should be ``[1,0,0]`` or 
  ``[-1,0,0]``.
  
  
Material specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The material specification should contain the following settings:

- ``"material_model"``: Name of the material model to use
- ``"mpar"``: Material parameters, given with new keywords.

The supported material models are described below. Note, however, that 
after the rail ``.cae`` file has been created, you can freely edit the 
material model specification.

Modifying the basic rail
------------------------
To script all details of how the rail should be meshed, and if there 
should be inclusions, cracks, etc. is rather cumbersome and not time 
efficient. Therefore, it is chosen to allow the user to edit the rail
part as an intermediate step. In general, creating the basic rail above
is not necessary, but highly recommended as it ensures that correct 
names are given to sets and surfaces. When modifying the rail part, it 
is therefore important not to change set names etc. With large geometric 
modifications, it might also be necessary to redefine these sets to 
capture the correct parts. A summary of the requirements for the rail
part that is used later when generating the rollover is given here.

*  The model should be named "RAIL"
*  The part should be named "RAIL"
*  Sets

   *  "BOTTOM_NODES" should contain all nodes at the bottom of the 
      rail
   *  "SIDE1_SET" should contain all nodes on the face at z=0
   *  "SIDE2_SET" should contain all nodes on the face at z=L where L is 
      the length of the rail.
   *  If present, "SYMMETRY" should contain all nodes on the symmetry face
      at x=0

.. Padding

*  Surfaces

   *  "RAIL_CONTACT_SURFACE" should be the surface where potential 
      contact with the wheel can occur.

.. Padding

*  Mesh

   *  The rail must be meshed, and no constraints should be added (i.e. 
      one cannot use incompatible meshes because this introduces 
      constraints between the nodes). 
   *  The mesh in "SIDE1_SET" and "SIDE2_SET" must match. I.e. the mesh 
      in "SIDE2_SET" should be a translation from the mesh in "SIDE1_SET".

.. Padding

*  Sections, including material definitions, must be defined on cells 
   of the part.


When working with TET elements, the script 
``make_rail_mesh_symmetric.py`` can be used to ensure a symmetric mesh.
Otherwise, if HEX meshes are used as a mapped mesh, this will also give
the same mesh on both sides. 


Create the wheel
================
A wheel super element is created by calling the abaqus script 
`create_wheel_3d.py` from a folder containing a file 
`rail_settings.json` This file should contain the following settings:

*  ``"wheel_name"`` (mandatory): Name of the folder where the 
   wheel data are placed
*  ``"wheel_angles"`` (mandatory): ``[min_ang, max_ang]``, 
   the angular interval containing the retained wheel nodes. 
   Wrt. the negative y-axis, 
   positive rotation around the x-axis. In radians.
*  ``"wheel_profile"`` (mandatory): Path to an Abaqus sketch, saved as a 
   ``.sat`` file, describing the profile of the wheel in the xy-plane. 
   See "Creating a profile sketch" above for further details.
*  ``"mesh_sizes"`` (mandatory): ``[fine, coarse]``,
   the fine and coarse mesh sizes for the wheel. 
*  ``"wheel_contact_pos"`` (mandatory): ``[xmin, xmax]``, the x-interval 
   for the part of the wheel that will be in contact with the rail. 
   This will describe which nodes will be retained, along with 
   ``"wheel_angles"``. 
*  ``"partition_line"`` (mandatory): y-coordinate (in the sketch) 
   for the line outside which the wheel mesh will use the 
   fine mesh size. 
*  ``"quadratic_order"`` (mandatory): Should linear or quadratic 
   wheel elements be used (``true`` or ``false``)
   
The created wheel folder can conveniently be placed in the data/wheels
directory in the repository 
(see `The data folder and how to specify paths`_).


Compile user subroutines
========================
The python script `create_usub.py` (in the `scripts_py` folder) 
is used to compile the user subroutines. To compile the default 
subroutine, run this script without any arguments. 

If you have additional user subroutines that you wish to use, 
give the path to the fortran source file (``<your_subroutines_file>``) 
for these subroutines. 
You can use include statements as long as all source files 
reside in the same folder (or subfolders) as the main file. 
In general, the subroutines should compile with 
``abaqus make library=<your_subroutines_file>`` from their 
specific folders.

The result will be (1) a folder `tmp_src_dir` and (2) a file 
`usubs_combined-std.o`/`usubs_combined-std.obj` (Windows/Linux)
The tmp_src_dir will contain all sources and a log file describing 
the compilation process (in case you have any issues). If it works 
successfully, you can delete this folder. The `usubs_combined-std` file 
should be copied (and probably renamed to a more descriptive name). It 
can be convenient to put it in the data/usubs directory in the 
repository (see `The data folder and how to specify paths`_).

Create the rollover simulation
==============================
A rollover simulation is created by running the Abaqus script
`create_rollover_3d.py`. 
It reads in the file ``rollover_settings.json`` which should contain 
the following settings:

*  ``"rail"``
   
   *  ``model_file``: Path to the rail ``.cae`` file to use
   *  ``shadow_extents``: ``[ext_at_z=0, ext_at_z=L]``
      How far out to create shadow regions in each end of the rail.
   *  ``use_rail_rp``: Boolean if rail reference point should be used 
      or not.
   
*  ``"wheel"``

   *  ``"folder``: Path to the folder describing the wheel super element
   *  ``"translation"``: How to translate the wheel (this depends on 
      both the rail and wheel geometry. Typically, the wheel origin is 
      in the wheel center and the rail origin is at the bottom of the 
      rail. 
   *  ``"stiffness"``: The stiffness (elastic modulus) of the wheel. 
      Its Poissons ratio is fixed at 0.3 from the wheel generation. 
   
*  ``"loading"``

   *  ``"initial_depression"``: Amount of displacement controlled 
      depression before changing to force control on the normal load. 
   *  ``"inbetween_step_time"``: Step time to use for the dummy steps
      (the initial depression, first loading, moving back, reapply load, 
      and release nodes)
   *  ``"inbetween_max_incr"``: Max allowed increments during the dummy 
      steps. To do it in a single increment is always attempted, except
      for the initial depression and first loading where 
      ``min(5, inbetween_max_incr)`` steps are used. 
   *  ``"rolling_length"``: The rolling length 
      **(must be equal to rail length!)**.
   *  ``"rolling_radius"``: The effective rolling radius 
      (used to convert slip to wheel rotation).
   *  ``"max_incr"``: Max number of increments to use during rolling.
   *  ``"min_incr"``: Minimum (and initial) number of increments during
      rolling. 
   *  ``"num_cycles"``: Number of rollover cycles to calculate (see also
      `Adding rolling cycles`_). 
   *  ``"cycles"``: ``[1, c_spec_2, ..., c_spec_N]``, 
      for which cycles that loading parameters are changed.
      See also `Specifying load parameters`_.
   *  ``"vertical_load"``: ``[F_1, F_2, ..., F_N]`` 
      Amount of force pushing the wheel onto the rail. 
   *  ``"speed"``: ``[v_1, v_2, ..., v_N]``
      The speed at which the wheel is rolling over the rail.
   *  ``"slip"``: ``[s_1, s_2, ...., s_N]``
      The amount of slip as the wheel rolls over the rail.
   *  ``"rail_ext"``: ``[e_1, e_2, ..., e_N]``
      The rail extension at the end of the cycle

*  ``"field_output"``
   *  ``"<field_output_1>"``: See `Field output description`_
   *  ``"<field_output_2>"``


Specifying load parameters
--------------------------
All load parameters, ``"cycles"``, ``"vertical_load"``, ``"speed"``,
``"slip"``, ``"rail_ext"`` are specified as lists with equal length.
The ``"cycles"`` list describe at which cycles the load parameters in 
the other categories shall be applied. If no specific setting exists for
a given cycle, the values from the previous cycle are used. Hence, the 
minimum requirement is to specify for the first cycle, and then this 
will be used for all subsequent cycles. 

The ``"slip"`` = :math:`s` is defined such that 

.. math::

   \dot{\phi} = (1+s)\frac{v}{R}

where :math:`\dot{\phi}` is the wheel rotation speed, :math:`v` is 
the linear wheel velocity (``"speed"``) and :math:`R` is the wheel 
radius (``"rolling_radius"``). 


Field output description
------------------------
The key under ``"field_output"`` gives the name of the specific 
field output request created, e.g. ``"<field_output_1>"``. 
And for each of these keys the following keys should be specified:

*  ``"set"``: The set in the rail part for which the output should be 
   saved. Note that there are two special names:
   * ``"FULL_MODEL"``: All parts of the model (wheel and rail)
   * ``"WHEEL_RP"``: The wheel reference point. 
*  ``"var"``: ``["VAR_1", "VAR_2", ..., "VAR_N"]``.
   The variables to be saved. Supported variables can be 
   found when creating field outputs in Abaqus CAE. But typical examples
   are "U" (displacements and rotations), "S" (stresses)
*  ``freq``: How many increments between each time the variables should
   be saved in the active steps of the field output request.
*  ``cycles``: How many cycles between each time the variables should be
   saved (i.e. between the active steps of the field output request). 
   If e.g. 25 is specified, output will occur on cycle 1, 26, 51, etc. 
   
   
Adding rolling cycles
---------------------
When adding many 100 steps, Abaqus CAE is rather slow. Therefore, a 
script is provided to extend a simulation by adding cycles with the same 
content repeated. Typically, if e.g. 25 is specified as the ``"cycle"``
above, then it sufficies to generate 26 cycles, and repeat these. The 
first cycle is not repeated, hence "doubling" the number of cycles will
then give 51 cycles in total. 

To add cycles, call the python script `append_extra_cycles.py` with the 
multiplication factor as the first argument and the input file as the 
second argument. The input file defaults to "rollover.inp".
If called with multiplication factor 4 in the above example, 101 cycles
would be created. 

Run simulation
==============
To run the simulation the following (generated) files are 
required to be in the simulation directory:

*  ``rollover.inp`` (can have different name): The Abaqus input file
*  ``load_param.txt`` (must have this name): 
   Automatically generated file in the same 
   directory as ``rollover.inp`` when creating rollver. 
   Describes the loading parameters 
*  ``uel_stiffness.txt`` (must have this name): 
   File specifying the wheel stiffness matrix. 
   Automatically generated when creating the wheel, automatically copied
   to the same directory as ``rollover.inp`` when creating rollover
*  ``rp_coord.txt`` (must have this name): 
   File specifying the location of the reference points.
   Automatically generated in the same folder as ``rollover.inp`` 
   when creating rollover.

In addition, the user subroutine object file must be available, but 
it does not need to reside in the simulation directory, but can be in 
a separate directory and its path specified as <path_to_usub>.

Run the simulation by

.. code-block:: bash

   abaqus job=rollover user=<path_to_usub>


Generic instructions
====================

In this section a few points that apply to multiple steps above are 
described. 

The json format
---------------
The ``json`` format is used for the input data. Mostly, the files 
should be written with a similar formatting as for a Python dictionary. 
However, there are a few important differences:

*  Booleans are written ``true`` and ``false``, 
   as opposed to ``True`` and ``False``.
*  All strings (keywords and variables) must be enclosed in double 
   quotes (single quotes are not accepted).
*  Exponential formats must be written ``A.BeC`` 
   (as opposed to ``A.eC``) where ``A``, ``B``, and ``C`` are integers. 
   E.g. ``1.0e-3`` is ok, but not ``1.e-3``.
*  Python's ``None`` is written as ``null``.
*  Comma is not allowed after the last item in a dictionary

To ensure the correct data format, one can write the following code in 
Python to generate the ``json`` file:

.. code-block::

   import json
   filename = 'example.json'	# Give the filename that you want to save to

   # Define the parameters you want to save as a Python dictionary
   param = {'key1': [1,2,3],	# Example of list data
           'key2': 'this is a string example data' # Example of string data
           }
   with open(filename, 'w') as fid:
      # Using indent=1 for nicer output, but not required
      json.dump(param, fid, indent=1)	


The data folder and how to specify paths
----------------------------------------
In the repository, there is a folder named "data". This contains some
examples (which are version controlled). However, additional contents 
added to the subfolders are ignored by the version control and are 
suitable for adding data that can be reused later. Examples include 
profile sketches, generated wheels and rails, and 
compiled user subroutines. 

To simplify the use of contents from this folder, path inputs in the 
``*_settings.json`` files can be relative the data folder. To do this, 
the path should start by ``":/"``, e.g. ``":/rails/rail_example.cae"``.
Otherwise, and absolute or relative (to the Abaqus working directory) 
path can be specified. 


Creating a profile sketch
-------------------------
To create a profile sketch in Abaqus CAE, perform the following steps:

1. Open Abaqus CAE
2. Double-click "Sketches" in the model tree
3. Give your sketch a name (this will have no effect later) and press
   "Continue"
4. Draw a profile and exit the sketch. 
5. Go "File"-"Export"-"Sketch..." and choose a location to save the 
   sketch.
6. In the new dialog box, select the sketch you want to export and press 
   "OK"
7. Choose the ACIS version. Just make sure that it can be read by your 
   system, press ok and you are done.
   
.. note:: The sketch will only contain the geometry, so if you later 
          want to edit a dimension later, you need to save the .cae
          file containing the sketch. Then you can edit the sketch in 
          this file later and export it again.
